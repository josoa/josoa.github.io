		<h3>What?</h3>
		<p><em>You're probably here because you heard I'm a visual communicator and a creative problem solver.</em> But I'm also a writer, a musician, a jogger, and a human.</p>

		<h3>Where?</h3>
		<p><em>Right now, I'm working toward a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University.</em> Observation was my best teacher previously. </p>

		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p><em>I find myself wondering the same thing.</em> At the end of most days, though, I know it's because design is hugely powerful and I want to harness that power for good. What kind of good? The good kind, obviously.</p>
